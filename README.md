# GameLobbyPrototype

GameLobbyPrototype is a foundational C++ project using the Qt framework designed to facilitate the creation of LAN-based multiplayer TCP games. This prototype enables a simple lobby system where players can connect, communicate, and prepare for a game in a LAN environment.

## Features

- **LAN Multiplayer Support**
- **Lobby System** 
  - **Host Creation**: A player can create a lobby, generating a unique code for others to join.
  - **Join by Code**: Players can join existing lobbies using the provided code.
- **Ready System**: The game starts automatically once all players in the lobby are marked as "ready."
- **In-Lobby Chat**
- **Screen Navigation System**
- **Pure C++ Implementation**: The entire project is written in C++, without using Qtâ€™s specific UI language (QML).
  
## Games Developed based on this repository

- **[BrushPhone](https://github.com/hadson0/BrushPhone)**: A multiplayer LAN game inspired by GarticPhone. Players take turns drawing and guessing.
